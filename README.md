## What is this?

Genesis is a multi-dimensional artificial life laboratory implementing six distinct simulation substrates in a single browser application. Each reveals a different mechanism by which complex, lifelike behavior emerges from simple mathematical rules. Every simulation runs entirely client-side — no backend. WebGL2 for GPU-accelerated substrates, pure canvas elsewhere.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kquant03/genesis-phase-transitions.git
cd genesis-phase-transitions
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:3000`.

## The Six Substrates

### ◈ Ising Model — Phase Transitions

<img src="docs/gifs/ising.gif" alt="2D Ising model at critical temperature showing domain fluctuations" width="256" align="right" />

The 2D Ising model on a square lattice — the cornerstone of statistical mechanics. The exact critical temperature T_c = 2/ln(1+√2) ≈ 2.269 separates ordered ferromagnetic domains from paramagnetic disorder via a continuous second-order phase transition.

**Features:**
- Dual Monte Carlo: Metropolis-Hastings (single-spin) + Wolff cluster (FK percolation)
- Hoshen-Kopelman cluster decomposition with golden-ratio coloring
- Four visualization modes: spin, cluster, domain walls, energy density
- Six live observables: M, |M|, E, χ, C_v, U_L (Binder cumulant)
- Social interpretation layer after Tsarev et al. (2019)
- Auto temperature sweep with susceptibility divergence at T_c

**Critical exponents (exact):** β = 1/8 · γ = 7/4 · ν = 1 · α = 0 (log) · η = 1/4 · δ = 15

### ◉ Lenia — Continuous Cellular Automata

<img src="docs/gifs/ghost_interaction.gif" alt="Lenia Ghost species — Orbium unicaudatus ignis var. phantasma — morphing and communicating through shared potential fields" width="256" align="right" />

After Bert Chan (2018). A continuous cellular automaton where space, time, and state are all smooth. WebGL2 GPU-accelerated with shader-based bloom, running at 60fps on a 256×256 toroidal grid. Eight species including *Orbium unicaudatus ignis* var. *phantasma* — the **Ghost**, a novel species engineered to inhabit the edge of chaos.

**The math:**
```
K(r) = exp(4 − 4 / (4r(1−r)))            Exponential bump kernel
U(x) = Σ K(‖x − y‖/R) · A(y)             Convolution potential field
G(u) = 2·exp(−(u − μ)² / 2σ²) − 1        Growth function
A^(t+dt) = clip(A^t + dt·G(U), 0, 1)      State update
```

**Eight species:** Orbium (glider soliton) · Bicaudatus (two-tailed) · Ignis (fire form) · Ignis ×2 (fire two-tailed) · Laxus (loose oscillator) · Vagus (large-field wanderer) · Soup (ecosystem) · **Ghost** (sustained edge-of-chaos morphing)

**The Ghost species** seeds the Ignis morphology (tuned for σ=0.012) under deliberately mismatched parameters (σ=0.015, R=15). The organism remembers its shape but cannot reach it — producing perpetual morphing, field-mediated inter-organism communication, and emergent network ripples across populations of 16 individuals.

### ✦ Lenia · Expanded Universe — Multi-Channel Ecosystem with 4D *Dihypersphaerome ventilans*

After Bert Chan (2020). The canonical second paper in the Lenia series extended the framework to higher dimensions, multiple kernels, and multiple coupled channels — discovering new phenomena including polyhedral symmetries, individuality, self-replication, and "virtual eukaryotes" with internal division of labor. Genesis implements a four-channel ecosystem grounded in this architecture, with a fourth channel dedicated to projecting the 4D species ***Dihypersphaerome ventilans*** (code: **3Hy2v**, Chinese: 乙超球, "second hypersphere") into the 2D world.

**The four channels:**
- **Ch0 — Prey** (amber/gold): Orbium-class gliders, single-peak kernel (μ=0.15, σ=0.017)
- **Ch1 — Predator** (electric cyan): Multi-peak kernel β=[1/3, 2/3, 1] (μ=0.26, σ=0.036). Starves without prey, consumes prey mass, suppresses prey growth in its vicinity
- **Ch2 — Morphogen** (deep teal): Wide diffuse field (R=20) secreted by both prey and predator. Spatially modulates σ for both channels — the morphogen landscape changes the physics of survival across the board
- **Ch3 — 4D Shadow**: The rotating 2D cross-section of *Dihypersphaerome ventilans*, bleeding into the prey channel and seeding the ecosystem from hyperspace

**The simulation pipeline (per frame):**
```
1. HYPER_FRAG:  rotate 4D DV body (XW/YW/ZW planes) → 2D cross-section
2. FLOW_FRAG:   compute velocity field from prey/morphogen gradients
3. SIM_FRAG:    advect state by flow → convolve 3 kernels → cross-channel coupling
4. DISPLAY:     ecosystem rendering (6 view modes including flow field and 4D projection)
5. BLOOM → COMPOSITE
```

**Cross-channel coupling:**
```
G₀ −= c₀₁·A₁                     predator suppresses prey growth
G₁ += c₁₀·A₀ − 0.012             prey feeds predator; starvation constant
σ₀_eff = σ₀·(1 + c₂₀·(A₂ − 0.3)) morphogen widens prey niche
G₀ += A₃·hyperMix·0.4             4D shadow seeds prey nucleation
Ã   = advect(A, ∇A·Φ)             flow advection on all channels
```

**About *Dihypersphaerome ventilans*:** DV is one of the rarest organisms in the Lenia taxonomy — a named 4D species whose behavior class is SO (Stationary Oscillation), subcategory *ventilans* (Latin: to fan, to breathe, to ventilate). It does not translate or rotate. It breathes. Its defining feature is a three-shell kernel with β = [1/12, 1/6, 1]: the outer ring weight is **12× stronger than the inner ring**, making the organism's boundary more important to its physics than its interior. It knows where it ends far better than it knows what it contains. [**→ Read the full DV species paper**](docs/Dihypersphaerome_ventilans-1.pdf)

The 4D hyperrotation controls in the right panel let you adjust the three rotation axes (XW, YW, ZW) independently, varying the appearance of its 2D cross-section from a faint ring at equatorial observation to near-nothing at the poles. The ZW rotation IS the breathing — adjusting its speed changes the ventilation rate.

**Five ecosystem presets:**
- **Duel** — 3 prey vs 1 predator. Classic initial conditions. Will they survive?
- **Swarm** — 8 prey vs 3 predators. Arms race conditions
- **Coexist** — Separated factions. Watch what happens at first contact
- **Invasion** — Established prey colony, predator invades from one side
- **DV Seed** — Empty ecosystem, only the 4D channel initialized. Prey nucleate from the Night Fury's shadow; predators follow. The ecosystem emerges from hyperspace

**Six view modes:** Ecosystem · Prey only · Predator only · 4D Projection · Flow Field · Morphogen

### ◎ Gray-Scott Reaction-Diffusion — Morphogenesis

<img src="docs/gifs/mitosis.gif" alt="Gray-Scott mitosis pattern showing self-replicating spots" width="256" align="right" />

The Gray-Scott model (Pearson, 1993) — two coupled PDEs that produce an extraordinary zoo of pattern types from spots that divide like cells to labyrinthine coral.

**The equations:**
```
∂u/∂t = D_u∇²u − uv² + F(1 − u)
∂v/∂t = D_v∇²v + uv² − (F + k)v
```

**Eight Pearson classification presets:** Mitosis (self-replicating spots) · Coral (labyrinthine) · Spirals · Worms · Solitons · U-Skate (gliders) · Waves · Bubbles

**Features:** Click-to-seed interaction, three color modes (chemical, heat, mono), real-time F/k parameter control spanning the full pattern space.

### ◆ Particle Life — Emergent Ecology

<img src="docs/gifs/particle_life.gif" alt="Particle Life showing emergent predator-prey dynamics from asymmetric forces" width="256" align="right" />

Asymmetric N×N force matrices between particle types. When A→B ≠ B→A, Newton's third law breaks and net energy enters the system — the minimal mechanism for predation, symbiosis, orbital capture, and membrane formation.

**Force function:**
```
Repulsion zone (r < β):    F(r) = r/β − 1
Interaction zone (r ≥ β):  F(r) = a · (1 − |1+β−2r| / (1−β))
```

Where `a = M[type_i][type_j]` from the asymmetric interaction matrix.

**Four matrix presets:** Random · Predator-Prey (cyclic chase) · Symbiosis (mutual attraction) · Chaos

**Features:** Live interaction matrix display, adjustable range/friction/repulsion, trail rendering.

### ◇ Primordial Particles — Life from Turning

<img src="docs/gifs/primordial.gif" alt="Primordial Particle Systems showing emergent cell-like structures" width="256" align="right" />

After Schmickl et al. (2016, *Scientific Reports*). The simplest known model producing a complete cell lifecycle. Each particle follows **one equation with two parameters:**

```
Δφᵢ = α + β · Nᵢ · sign(Rᵢ − Lᵢ)
```

From this alone: cells form, grow, divide, produce spores, migrate, self-repair, and exhibit logistic population dynamics. The "Region of Life" exists at α ≈ 180°, β ≈ 17°.

**Five presets:** Cell Life · Worms · Swirls · Crystals · Gas

**Features:** Density-based coloring (neighbor count), heading-based coloring, real-time α/β control.

## Connection to Broader Research

This repository is part of the **Teármann Research Ecosystem:**

- **Shoal-Broadcast Architecture** — The Ghost species IS the shoal-broadcast pattern made visible: organisms communicating not through discrete messages but through perturbations in a shared continuous scalar field. Each Ghost's morphological instability becomes a signal source for its neighbors. The Expanded Universe substrate takes this further: the morphogen field (ch2) is a broadcast medium sculpted in real time by every organism in the simulation.
- **Tsarev–Dicke Mapping** — The Ising substrate connects to Tsarev et al.'s quantum-optics model of social opinion dynamics, where the superradiant phase transition = spontaneous consensus formation
- **CLAIRE/Teármann Thesis** — Mechanistically transparent simulation data formally collapses underspecification in ML training. Every causal pathway in Genesis is observable. The 4D projection in the Expanded Universe substrate makes this literal: the causal influence of a 4D organism on a 2D ecosystem is fully traced, frame by frame, through the hyperMix parameter.
- ***Dihypersphaerome ventilans* and the Layer 4 thesis** — DV lives in a dimension that 2D Lenia cannot represent. Its influence on the 2D ecosystem is real but indirect — mediated through projection and cross-channel bleeding. This is an analogy for Layer 4 reasoning: thinking *across* causal graph structures rather than within them. The Night Fury seeds the world it moves through without being visible in it.
